Tartarus is a bootloader targeting 64bit architectures. Currently only x86_64 is supported (legacy bios and uefi). Tartarus supports multiple protocols, main one being the [Tartarus Protocol](./protocol.md). The [config.md](./config.md) file describes the configuration file tartarus uses to boot.

**Note:** Tartarus is still in development.
