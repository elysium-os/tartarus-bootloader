# Tartarus
Tartarus is a bootloader targeting 64bit architectures. Currently only x86_64 is supported, both legacy bios and uefi. Tartarus supports multiple protocols, one of them being the [Tartarus Protocol](./protocol.md). The [config.md](config.md) file describes the configuration file tartarus uses to boot.

**Note:** Tartarus is still in development.

*Tartarus uses [Limine EFI](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine-efi) for the efi buildsystem.*
